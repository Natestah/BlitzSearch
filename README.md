[Blitz Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UYPwQY9ngm) - Feedback is welcome, This is my personal Discord and shares topics of game dev things.

## Supported IDEs and Extension Source

There are varying levels of support on these, with all but Jetbrains having feature parity.  You should be able to rebind Find/Replace in these editors.

I personally have Blitz Search as the stand in for all but Jetbrains ( there are some points there that I wont ever be able to hit ).
