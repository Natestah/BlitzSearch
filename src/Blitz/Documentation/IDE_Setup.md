# IDE Setup information

Blitz Search has Plugins for many IDE's and Text Editors. 

They each include a command that I call "Search This". This command does something super useful, that is save you from using copy-paste to search a thing. Much like many of the IDE commands when you press control-shift-f.

This command does the following:

## With No Selection and Caret on a word:
* Whole-word search on that word

## With text Selected
* Search just that word as a substring ( part of word ) match

This is an important ingredient in Serving as a Find-In-Files alternative because using the Clipboard is not ideal. You wouldn't use a clipboard with the internal search.
