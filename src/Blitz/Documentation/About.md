Blitz Search is an Idea that has been on my mind for some time. I love the idea of elevating this primitive function.

Especially today when the world goes all in on AI Coding agents.  To embellish one of the dumbest yet still useful functions of the text editor.

I hope you enjoy, I hope Blitz Search finds its way into the hearts of many Engineers alike.

I'm Nathan Silvers, I've been telling a fantastic story of my lifes work on Call of Duty and video games here on my Twitter profile please do take a minute sometime, it's been a wild ride!
