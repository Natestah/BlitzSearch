### Nathan Silvers
I have been doing "cool things" with computers since I graduated High School in 1999.  

Being a Consumer of software tools in general for the greater half of my professional Games Development career.  I became somewhat obsessed with side projects to Help gameplay scripters find their way.

I worked as a Level Designer with ~25 people who Started the Call Of Duty Franchise and later devoted myself to developing tools for the game.

Now Having 8 years of real-world professional software development behind me, I am ready to try something new!

Thank you for taking a look!
