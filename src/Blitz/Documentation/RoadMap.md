# RoadMap

Blitz Search is currently in development.  This roadmap is to provide a rough outlook for anyone curious about my plans with Blitz Search.

While I'm currently enjoying leisurely development it may take some time to hit these points. Come September ( kids back in school ) this stuff should heat up.

For this reason I'm not currently constraining myself to order or timing.
